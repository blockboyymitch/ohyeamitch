The government is not my friend

I put my trust in them and they always let me down 

They promise the country better is coming 

And instead we get worse 

And we wonder why so much is going on in the world 

Police abusing people 

African Americans in specific 

Trump lying about how he will make America great again 

So much talk from the government 

But like they say actions speak louder than words 

And so far words are speaking louder than actions 

How can I trust the government?
